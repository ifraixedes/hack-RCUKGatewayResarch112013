Challenge highlights the importance of pyrolysis-oil as the potential replacement for transport fuels with low system GHG (green house gases) emissions. The two main barriers are outlined in Pyrolysis Challenge : a) to develop fast pyrolysis process to produce a better quality oil at low cost and large scale; b) upgrading the oil preferably with existing refinery. Without the technology and capacity to provide pyrolysis oils in large quantity and low cost, the investment in developing bio-oil upgrading technology and refinery will not be forthcoming. Therefore the development of fast pyroloysis process suitable for scale-up is the most impending issue. This project will focus on the development of computational models which work as effective tools for process design, optimisation and scale-up for biomass fast pyrolysis systems. UK has the technology base to become the world leader in pyrolysis technology and South Africa has the potential to be a major pyrolysis oil manufacturer in the world. This proposal is to form a constructive collaboration with UK expertise in computational modelling and South Africa experience in chemical process engineering. The UK and SA institutes will act as hubs to integrate this project with on-going national research programmes to enable a much wider participation.

An emerging technology combining a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) and a gas turbine (GT) systems promises to dramatically increase the overall energy efficiency and significantly reduce the level of harmful emissions. Moreover, a lower overall cost can be achieved. Equally importantly, as an SOFC system operates within a high temperature range, a wide variety of hydrocarbon fuels can be utilized directly without pre-reforming, increasing the life-cycle efficiency and versatility of such a hybrid system. In a hybrid SOFC-GT system, the unspent exhaust fuel and high-grade heat from an SOFC system are utilized in the GT combustor, often in combination with a fresh stream of fuel-oxidizer mixture. The main challenge is to burn the exhaust fuel efficiently, when the reactant mixture is highly diluted with water steam (H2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2). As the mixture composition varies both spatially and temporally, combustion can take place in non-premixed and premixed modes in various parts of the combustor. It is also likely to have a mixed mode, called triple flames or edge flames, which exhibits features in between non-premixed and premixed modes. Local flame extinction and auto-ignition are expected to be significant. Such a scenario presents theoretical and modelling challenges, as well as difficulties for the design of the combustor. Diluted combustion under turbulent conditions similar to those in a hybrid SOFC-GT system must be systematically studied to put the construction of the next generation low-emission high-efficiency power systems on a firmer scientific foundation.Given the complexity of the complete problem under concern, the proposed research will focus on generic, fundamental issues related to turbulent combustion in the GT combustor. Direct numerical simulation (DNS), theoretical modelling and analysis will be conducted on a vitiated methane-air flame with a coflow. This base configuration is chosen to match that used in a series of experimental studies by a group at UC Berkeley on lifted flame stabilization in gas turbine combustors, so that useful experimental data is available for comparison. The study will consists of four main parts: (1) DNS of vitiated methane-air flames using multi-step systematically reduced chemical kinetics, greatly extending the capability of DNS as a predictive tool; (2) Parametric studies with various combinations of H2O and/or CO2 dilution and a varying degree of premixing; (3) Evaluation and further development of theories and models for partially premixed flames; and (4) Critical assessment of performance and operational issues related to hybrid SOFC-GT systems. The DNS will utilize national high-end computing (HEC) facilities HPCx and HECToR. The research will involve collaboration with three research groups in the USA. The results will be disseminated in international conferences and journals as well as at meetings and the website of the Consortium on Computational Combustion for Engineering Applications, funded by the EPSRC grant No. EP/D080223/1 (2006-2009).","techAbstractText":null,"potentialImpact":null,"start":null,"end":null},{"links":{"link":[{"href":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/gtr/api/persons/A838D078-9338-43A0-808B-9D18851BBF3F","rel":"PI_PER","start":null,"end":null,"otherAttributes":{}},{"href":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/gtr/api/organisations/30A429E3-83B7-4E41-99C0-14A144F07DFE","rel":"LEAD_ORG","start":null,"end":null,"otherAttributes":{}},{"href":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/gtr/api/funds/D3922BC7-611E-40D3-A489-054A52EAE3A9","rel":"FUND","start":1285801200000,"end":1329004800000,"otherAttributes":{}},{"href":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/gtr/api/outcomes/publications/00430033-0033-0037-4100-460031004300","rel":"PUBLICATION","start":null,"end":null,"otherAttributes":{}},{"href":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/gtr/api/outcomes/publications/00340039-0032-0037-3500-380037003200","rel":"PUBLICATION","start":null,"end":null,"otherAttributes":{}},{"href":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/gtr/api/outcomes/publications/00330036-0043-0031-3500-380045003600","rel":"PUBLICATION","start":null,"end":null,"otherAttributes":{}},{"href":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/gtr/api/outcomes/publications/00330045-0045-0041-3100-410035004400","rel":"PUBLICATION","start":null,"end":null,"otherAttributes":{}}]},"ext":null,"id":"AA2EB92D-8B8F-4A65-BDC0-82F08F47D0D8","href":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/gtr/api/projects/AA2EB92D-8B8F-4A65-BDC0-82F08F47D0D8","created":1384416494000,"updated":null,"identifiers":{"identifier":[{"value":"EP/I000801/1","type":"RCUK"}]},"title":"HECToR-enabled Step Change in Turbulent Multiphase Combustion Simulation","status":null,"grantCategory":null,"abstractText":"Over the past few years, we have concentrated efforts on a relatively new class of turbulent multiphase combustion, that is, turbulent combustion diluted by a liquid phase. Such diluted combustion is different from the conventional spray combustion (e.g. in diesel engines) and has applications in several low-emission high-efficiency energy systems and fire safety. Through a systematic approach and a series of jounral and conference publications, we have established a computational prototype of the phenomena, which is generic, phenomena-rich, scientifically interesting yet computationally amenable (on HEC!) and efficient. HECToR Phases 2a and 2b offer unprecedented opportunities for advanced simulations in turbulent multiphase combustion. The new Baker system, in particular, will have a peak speed of about 340 Tflops and 60 TB available, which is anticipated to consist of 44,544 cores (2x12 core chips and 32GB memory per node) giving a theoretical peak of around 340TF.We aim to conduct landmark simulations of turbulent multiphase diluted combustion on HECToR in order to make a step change in our understanding of key phenomena and potentially optimize applications of the technology. On the Baker system, we will conduct DNS of turbulent combustion diluted by evaporating droplets in order of increasing size and sophistication on up to 12,000 cores. Thereafter, the Lattice Boltzmann Method will be dynamically coupled with DNS to form a multi-scale simulation of fully resolved droplets in turbulent combustion.

It offers significant advantages over other competing printing methodologies and has potential applications in many high-tech high-value industries. However, questions remain regarding how to select a small set of experimentally controllable parameters to produce the finest, the most uniform, the most desirable single printed feature and print arrays. Despite the extensive and expensive experiments carried out by the applicants and other groups around the world, fundamental understanding of the phenomena involved in LIFT is lacking. This is attributed to the limited spatial and temporal resolutions in experiments and to the fact that many quantities/properties are not directly measurable especially at nanoscales. Crucially, the causal relationships among the various parameters are difficult to establish without an exhaustive number of expensive experiments. Therefore, it is highly desirable to develop theoretical and/or numerical models to capture the essential physics in LIFT so that trends can be predicted more easily and LIFT design more grounded on fundamental physics. Success here will revolutionise key industries that have photonics, plasmonics and microelectronics as their cornerstone.Conventional macroscopic modelling methods do not directly lend the solution to the LIFT problem, due to the truly multiscale and multiphysics features of LIFT. The most promising approach for LIFT is the LBM, which can be viewed as a coarse-grained molecular dynamics approach, albeit with very different numerical algorithms and affordable computational expenses for real-world problems. LBM preserves the microscopic kinetic principles while recovering the full Navier-Stokes equations at the macroscales. Therefore, LBM bridges the microscales and macroscales, which makes it a valuable method for multiscale problems like LIFT. Here, we propose the very first multiscale modelling study of LIFT, supported by existing and further experimental measurements conducted at the state-of-the-art FASTlab facilities in Southampton. This is built upon the recent successes of ours and other researchers in simulating some isolated sub-processes relevant to LIFT using LBM. The novelty and significance of the proposed multiscale LBM approach is its ability to simulate the complete LIFT process including donor material melting, molten droplet formation, droplet growth, transfer, and deposition processes. The model development will proceed in a systematic manner in order of increasing sophistication. First, an isothermal multiphase LBM model will be employed to isolate the multiphase flow dynamics effects from the thermal effects. Then a thermal multiphase LBM will be tested for LIFT processes to determine the capabilities and limitations of the current (pure) LBM methodologies. The focus, however, is to develop a new multiscale LBM approach to study laser heating, donor material melting, heat conduction, thermal expansion and re-solidification. Such a multiscale approach couples LBM seamlessly with a macroscopic Navier-Stokes solver, taking advantage of each method's scale-resolving capability and numerical efficiency in different ranges of the Reynolds and Knudsen numbers. Finally, Marangoni effects will be investigated by incorporating temperature-dependent surface tension into the LBM modelling. The Marangoni effects are believed to affect the final morphology of the printed features but have not been studied in detail before. Throughout the project, the modelling and experimental teams as well as our academic and industrial partners will work closely with each other to ensure timely exchange of ideas, data and information.

The dual requirements for high energy efficiency and minimal pollution for sustainable developments place an urgent demand on better understanding of and more accurate predictive tools for combustion processes. With its inherent complex and interdisciplinary nature, combustion is a major challenge for the science and engineering research communities, which can only be met through collaborative research using the most advanced tools available. Over the past decade, High End Computing (HEC) has been a driving force for deploying advanced numerical and modelling tools for fundamental and applied combustion research. The Consortium on Computational Combustion for Engineering Applications (COCCFEA) has been at the forefront of joint exploitation of HEC resources for the advancement of combustion science and technology over a decade, which has benefited immensely from EPSRC's strategic investment in HEC. A new grant is sought to continue its work, with the aim of exploiting HPCx and in particular, the proposed HECToR to tackle more realistic combustion problems in engineering applications as well as emerging topics related to sustainability, security and micro and nanotechnologies. New emphasizes are placed on integration of methods and tools, training of PhD students and dissemination of results at the highest level.","techAbstractText":null,"potentialImpact":null,"start":null,"end":null},{"links":{"link":[{"href":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/gtr/api/persons/A53B317D-1B3C-4580-B64D-85C00233BC59","rel":"PI_PER","start":null,"end":null,"otherAttributes":{}},{"href":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/gtr/api/persons/497B9BF6-F2EA-4BCA-B71D-441759C4944F","rel":"COI_PER","start":null,"end":null,"otherAttributes":{}},{"href":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/gtr/api/persons/CF94DC8E-27CD-4977-B89A-447578CCAFF5","rel":"COI_PER","start":null,"end":null,"otherAttributes":{}},{"href":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/gtr/api/persons/C4358C1B-3110-45C4-BBE6-22FBAAB56EBD","rel":"COI_PER","start":null,"end":null,"otherAttributes":{}},{"href":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/gtr/api/persons/8D6622C5-6832-4C36-8BDC-D3074E7CAB90","rel":"COI_PER","start":null,"end":null,"otherAttributes":{}},{"href":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/gtr/api/persons/E430B35C-A2F0-4389-A836-8AA333784BE0","rel":"COI_PER","start":null,"end":null,"otherAttributes":{}},{"href":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/gtr/api/persons/64F961C8-339F-4D5D-B9FC-1F28F0F9054B","rel":"COI_PER","start":null,"end":null,"otherAttributes":{}},{"href":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/gtr/api/persons/ED117740-EC53-4A89-A673-A4CFFBECB786","rel":"COI_PER","start":null,"end":null,"otherAttributes":{}},{"href":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/gtr/api/persons/CCA35CBF-B6BC-4E98-84A5-404BF8304B1B","rel":"COI_PER","start":null,"end":null,"otherAttributes":{}},{"href":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/gtr/api/persons/872A195F-7D49-45BC-ADA2-BE30F3029B03","rel":"COI_PER","start":null,"end":null,"otherAttributes":{}},{"href":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/gtr/api/persons/A838D078-9338-43A0-808B-9D18851BBF3F","rel":"COI_PER","start":null,"end":null,"otherAttributes":{}},{"href":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/gtr/api/persons/07EF6383-59E1-4E15-90F6-50B74B9F220F","rel":"COI_PER","start":null,"end":null,"otherAttributes":{}},{"href":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/gtr/api/persons/6FF0F04A-FC4E-4110-A825-12FD1EDAC9E9","rel":"COI_PER","start":null,"end":null,"otherAttributes":{}},{"href":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/gtr/api/persons/36E52DF3-CED8-4FFE-B198-21284D0FDA6F","rel":"COI_PER","start":null,"end":null,"otherAttributes":{}},{"href":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/gtr/api/persons/989E9C43-5D70-4D8A-ADA7-531FCE8B46A6","rel":"COI_PER","start":null,"end":null,"otherAttributes":{}},{"href":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/gtr/api/persons/FF04A1E0-C54B-4B74-8C07-D74F591EC98F","rel":"COI_PER","start":null,"end":null,"otherAttributes":{}},{"href":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/gtr/api/organisations/30A429E3-83B7-4E41-99C0-14A144F07DFE","rel":"LEAD_ORG","start":null,"end":null,"otherAttributes":{}},{"href":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/gtr/api/funds/C489978F-1ECC-49BD-8611-7A55DF9D8384","rel":"FUND","start":1141776000000,"end":1241650800000,"otherAttributes":{}},{"href":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/gtr/api/outcomes/publications/00440037-0036-0032-3300-410035004600","rel":"PUBLICATION","start":null,"end":null,"otherAttributes":{}},{"href":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/gtr/api/outcomes/publications/00370033-0030-0033-3300-310041004200","rel":"PUBLICATION","start":null,"end":null,"otherAttributes":{}},{"href":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/gtr/api/outcomes/publications/00330039-0036-0042-4400-430044004500","rel":"PUBLICATION","start":null,"end":null,"otherAttributes":{}},{"href":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/gtr/api/outcomes/publications/00330043-0042-0031-4300-340039004500","rel":"PUBLICATION","start":null,"end":null,"otherAttributes":{}},{"href":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/gtr/api/outcomes/publications/00330035-0034-0044-4100-410031003900","rel":"PUBLICATION","start":null,"end":null,"otherAttributes":{}}]},"ext":null,"id":"B08B0475-E1AA-4F17-B002-8BF316945648","href":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/gtr/api/projects/B08B0475-E1AA-4F17-B002-8BF316945648","created":1384416494000,"updated":null,"identifiers":{"identifier":[{"value":"EP/D044073/1","type":"RCUK"}]},"title":"UK Turbulence Consortium","status":null,"grantCategory":null,"abstractText":"An expanded turbulence consortium is proposed to investigate many aspects of the turbulence problem using numerical simulations.

The proposed research has a strong focus on industrial needs by integrating with the industrial partner's existing activities for developing CCS technologies suitable for commercial gas power plants. E.ON is generating around 10% of the UK's electricity and is committed to reducing its CO2 emission by 50% by 2030 (1990 baseline). E.ON has setup a dedicated CCS unit to address the technical challenges while one of the priorities is to develop CCS technologies suitable for natural gas power stations. This research specifically targets at natural gas power plants, which has a lower concentration of CO2 approx. 4% compared to 13% from coal-fired plants, and harder to extract, representing the most challenging case for CCS.\n\nCarbon capture and storage involves separating the CO2 from emissions so it can be transported and stored away from the atmosphere. The most commercially viable approach to be fitted in natural gas power plants is the post-combustion capture which absorbs CO2 from the flue gas using a chemical reaction - also known as scrubbing, which E.ON has been actively pursuing and will be the focus of this research. Whilst research on the chemical processes has been taking place for several decades, CFD modelling of the reactor is a recent development. E.ON has recognised that CFD plays a vital role in the optimisation of current CCS reactors by including more CFD research in their future research strategy. University of Southampton is a prime place for CFD based research while the School of Engineering Sciences currently holds &pound;5M CFD focused EPSRC projects. The combined expertise forms a strong academic and industrial partnership to tackle current barriers of reactor scale-up in carbon capture using advanced CFD models. \n\nBy addressing all the challenges outlined in te EPSRC call, this research aims to design an optimised reactor using a novel CFD modelling approach that is capable of achieving in excess of 90% CO2 absorption whilst ensuring the cost of service energy is minimised to below 35%. The new concept idea will incorporate improved mixing designs and improved heat transfer whilst reducing reactor size. It is planned through the enhancement of current CFD multiphase models to incorporate reaction and the inclusion of flow control devices that an optimal structured packing arrangement, which promotes the reaction process whilst reducing pressure drop, can be found. This project will not only produce conceptual ideas developed through enhance CFD methods but will also perform tests, in a lab-scale reactor, to determine its validity with respect to its flow dynamics and would potentially lead to the production of intellectual

Turbulence Consortium","status":null,"grantCategory":null,"abstractText":"An expanded high-performance computing (HPC) consortium is proposed to investigate fundamental aspects of the turbulence problem using numerical simulation. Cases include transitional and fully developed turbulent flows in canonical and complex geometries, with relevance to a wide range of engineering, environmental/geophysical and biological applications. The consortium will serve to coordinate, augment and unify the research efforts of its participants, and to communicate its expertise and findings to an international audience. Most of the staff resource to carry out the scientific work is already in place, funded by EPSRC or other sources, and in all cases the projects have qualified and available staff in place to complete them.

The instability arises due to complex interactions among acoustics, heat release and transport, and hydrodynamics, which occur over a huge span of time/length scales. In the past, various aspects of the interaction were modelled in isolation, and often on an empirical basis. Advanced mathematical techniques, matched asymptotic expansion technique and multiple-scale methods, provide a means to tackle this multi-physical phenomenon in a self-consistent and systematical manner. By using this approach, a first-principle flame-acoustic interaction theory, valid in the so-called corrugated flamelet regime, has been derived recently. The reduced system in the theory ratains the key mechanisms of combustions instability but is much more tractable computationally. In the present proposed project, the flame-acoustic interaction theory will be extended first to account for the influence of a general externally imposed perturbation. A more general asymptotic theory will be formulated in the so-called thin-reaction-zone regime. Numerical algorithms to solve the asymptotically reduced systems will be developed. The asymptotic theories and numerical methods provide, in principle, an efficient tool for predicting the onset of combustion instability. The fidelity of this approach will be assessed by accurate direct numerical simulations (DNS). It will be applied to the situations pertaining to important experiments in order to predict a number of remarkable phenomena, such as self-sustained oscillations, flame stabilization by pressure oscillations, parametric instability induced by pressure and/or enthalpy fluctuations and onset of chaotic flames. The theoretical models will be employed to develop effective active control of combustion instability by modulating fuel rate, and the effectiveness and robustness of the controllers designed will be tested by simulations using the asymptotic models as well as the fundamental equations for reacting flows.","techAbstractText":null,"potentialImpact":null,"start":null,"end":null},{"links":{"link":[{"href":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/gtr/api/persons/A838D078-9338-43A0-808B-9D18851BBF3F","rel":"PI_PER","start":null,"end":null,"otherAttributes":{}},{"href":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/gtr/api/persons/CF94DC8E-27CD-4977-B89A-447578CCAFF5","rel":"COI_PER","start":null,"end":null,"otherAttributes":{}},{"href":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/gtr/api/persons/FF04A1E0-C54B-4B74-8C07-D74F591EC98F","rel":"COI_PER","start":null,"end":null,"otherAttributes":{}},{"href":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/gtr/api/organisations/30A429E3-83B7-4E41-99C0-14A144F07DFE","rel":"LEAD_ORG","start":null,"end":null,"otherAttributes":{}},{"href":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/gtr/api/funds/CFD121BD-94DB-464D-95B2-F6CE975BDA27","rel":"FUND","start":1349046000000,"end":1375225200000,"otherAttributes":{}}]},"ext":null,"id":"DDFB29AA-8F1B-4145-A14B-965B05956777","href":"http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/gtr/api/projects/DDFB29AA-8F1B-4145-A14B-965B05956777","created":1384416494000,"updated":null,"identifiers":{"identifier":[{"value":"EP/J016381/1","type":"RCUK"}]},"title":"Thermal and Reactive Flow Simulation on High-End Computers","status":null,"grantCategory":null,"abstractText":"Thermal and reactive flows are cross-cutting fundamental disciplines that have found applications in technologies such as aerospace engineering, combustion engines for power generation and propulsion, geothermal energy, solar thermal energy, bioenergy, nanotechnology, chemical engineering and climate science, etc. Research in the field is a prime example where high-end computing (HEC) can have a crucial impact, as the reliability and accuracy of numerical prediction and diagnosis of thermal and reactive flows are directly linked to the computational grid resolution and the size of the time steps. The reason lies with the extremely wide range of time and length scales present in thermal and reactive flows, which are typically turbulent as well. There are 9 to 12 orders of magnitude change between the smallest and the largest length and time scales present in thermal and reactive flows of technical relevance, which should ideally be resolved by experimental measurement or numerical simulation. To study such complex phenomena by experiment alone would be prohibitively expensive and laborious if possible at all. Numerical simulation, on the other hand, offers non-intrusive, virtual &quot;measurement&quot; of all relevant quantities at desired resolution and accuracy, provided sufficient computing power is available. Over the past two decades, the world has first seen gigaflops supercomputers, then teraflops and more recently petaflops machines. The pace of development towards exa-scale HEC platforms has recently quickened. Only last autumn, Tianhe-1A caused a stir by reaching 2.566 petaflops maximum sustained calculation speed, but six months later the K computer achieved an astonishing 8.162 petaflops. At least two HEC machines with 20 petaflops are being built in the world and expected to enter service next year (http://www.top500.org/). The problem is that advance in supercomputing hardware and software, impressive as it appears, has barely kept pace with the research needs. Therefore, frontier research in computational thermal and reactive flows tends to be strongly associated with making use of the latest HEC available. \n \nWe believe that HEC is a key enabler of cutting-edge research in thermal and reactive flow flows. The main purpose of this application is to secure HEC resources on HECToR and its successors to support funded research projects in the field. These include: (a) K H Luo (P.I.), EPSRC grant No. EP/I016570/1 (09/2011 - 08/2014), &quot;Tackling Combustion Instability in Low-Emission Energy Systems: Mathematical Modelling. Numerical Simulations and Control Algorithms&quot;; (b) K H Luo (P.I.) and R W Eason, EPSRC grant No. EP/I012605/1 (05/2011 - 05/2014), &quot;Laser-Induced Forward Transfer Nano-Printing Process - Multiscale Modelling, Experimental Validation and Optimization&quot;; and (c) N D Sandham (P.I.), on-going LAPCAT II EU/FP7, &quot;Long-term advanced propulsion concepets and technologies&quot;. In addition, the widely used SBLI code first developed by the applicants will be extended to incorporate capabilities for reactive flow simulation. By making use of the world-class computing facility HECToR, the above projects will fulfil the objectives of producing significant, world-leading research results. Examples of world-first simulations will include: (a) largest direct numerical simulation of a turbulent premixed flame interacting with acoustic waves (b) lattice Boltzmann simulation of the complete Laser-Induced Forward Transfer (LIFT) process; and (c) large-eddy simulation of a complete nose-to-tail scramjet engine. These projects are of direct interest to large research communities in aerospace engineering, combustion, nanotechnology, high-performance computing and so on, and will involve a dozen UK and EU companies, which will ensure wide and timely dissemination of research results.","techAbstractText":null,"potentialImpact":null,"start":null,"end":null}]}
